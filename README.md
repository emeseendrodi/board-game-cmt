# CMT Board Game 

## Project Description
This is a browser-based board game implemented in React. The goal is to fill a 5x5 table by clicking cells in a round-robin manner (C, M, T). The game highlights consecutive lines of 3 or more identical characters and displays the score at the end.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or later recommended)
- npm (comes bundled with Node.js)

To check if Node.js and npm are installed, run the following commands in your terminal

    node -v
    npm -v

If these commands return version numbers, you're ready to proceed. If not, follow these steps:

    Go to the Node.js download page.
    Download and install the LTS (Long-Term Support) version, as it is more stable and recommended for most projects.
    During installation, ensure that npm is selected (it is included by default with Node.js).
